<h2>
	<span style="color:#a52a2a;"><span style="font-size: 22px;">Brewerâ€™s Yeast or Marmite</span></span></h2>

<span style="font-size:18px;">
Turns out there was at least one good reason to sprinkle brewer&rsquo;s yeast on your granola: it&rsquo;s one of the best food source of thiamine, also called vitamin B1, and pyridoxine, also called vitamin B6, both of which are linked with brain function in numerous ways. (Spreading marmite on your toast also works.)<br />
<br />
Thiamine deficiency is known to cause a form of dementia, which is why researchers are studying the possibility that thiamine supplementation may help prevent or slow the development of Alzheimer&rsquo;s and dementia. Meanwhile, pyridoxine plays a role in neurotransmitter production, and thus in strengthening memory and cognition. Large amounts of thiamine and pyridoxine aren&rsquo;t easy to find in any one food, and one of the best dietary sources is actually fortified cereals. But many, many foods, including bananas, black beans, lentils, eggs, pork, and sunflower seeds all have have good quantities of these B vitamins so eating a varied diet helps.
