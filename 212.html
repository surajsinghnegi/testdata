You don&rsquo;t see crab on many power food lists, do you? But you should. One serving of crab has 1840 mg (more than your entire daily requirement) of phenylalanine, an amino acid needed to make the important neurotransmitter dopamine, as well as brain-stimulating adrenaline and noradrenaline and thyroid hormone.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Many types of fish and seafood are rich in phenylalanine, but I&rsquo;m singling crab out because it&rsquo;s easy to find and it&rsquo;s less likely to be high in mercury, an issue with tuna and other popular fish. Research also suggests phenylalanine may be helpful in combating Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. Added value: Crab is also one of the best dietary sources of vitamin B12 (see below) with one serving providing 192 percent of your daily requirement.
