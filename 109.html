Our senses work together so it is important to stimulate them! Your head crackles with the perceptions of the whole world, sight, sound, taste, smell, touch, energetic as a frat party.<br />
<br />
Smell is unusually effective at evoking memory. If you&#39;re tested on the details of a movie while the smell of popcorn is wafted into the air, you&#39;ll remember 10-50% more.<br />
<br />
Smell is really important to business. When you walk into Starbucks, the first thing you smell is coffee. They have done a number of things over the years to make sure that&rsquo;s the case.<br />
