<span style="font-size:18px;">
What YOU do and learn in life physically changes what your brain looks like &ndash; it literally rewires it. We used to think there were just 7 categories of intelligence. But categories of intelligence may number more than 7 billion&mdash;roughly the population of the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
No two people have the same brain, not even twins. Every student&rsquo;s brain, every employee&rsquo;s brain, every customer&rsquo;s brain is wired differently.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can either accede to it or ignore it. The current system of education ignores it by having grade structures based on age. Businesses such as Amazon are catching on to mass customization (the Amazon homepage and the products you see are tailored to your recent purchases).<br />
<br />
<br />
Regions of the brain develop at different rates in different people. The brains of school children are just as unevenly developed as their bodies. Our school system ignores the fact that every brain is wired differently. We wrongly assume every brain is the same.<br />
Most of us have a &ldquo;Jennifer Aniston&rdquo; neuron (a neuron lurking in your head that is stimulated only when Jennifer Aniston is in the room).
