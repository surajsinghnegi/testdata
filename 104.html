When we&rsquo;re asleep, the brain is not resting at all. It is almost unbelievably active! It&rsquo;s possible that the reason we need to sleep is so that we can learn.<br />
Sleep must be important because we spend 1/3 of our lives doing it! Loss of sleep hurts attention, executive function, working memory, mood, quantitative skills, logical reasoning, and even motor dexterity.<br />
We still don&rsquo;t know how much we need! It changes with age, gender, pregnancy, puberty, and so much more.<br />
Napping is normal. Ever feel tired in the afternoon? That&rsquo;s because your brain really wants to take a nap. There&#39;s a battle raging in your head between two armies. Each army is made of legions of brain cells and biochemicals &ndash;- one desperately trying to keep you awake, the other desperately trying to force you to sleep. Around 3 p.m., 12 hours after the midpoint of your sleep, all your brain wants to do is nap.<br />
Taking a nap might make you more productive. In one study, a 26-minute nap improved NASA pilots&rsquo; performance by 34 percent.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t schedule important meetings at 3 p.m. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.
