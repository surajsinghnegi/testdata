It&rsquo;s not easy to find good food sources of magnesium, a mineral that plays a key role in energy metabolism. But it&rsquo;s important &ndash; magnesium is highly beneficial for brain cell receptors, speeding message transmission. Magnesium also relaxes blood vessels, letting more blood through to feed the brain<br />
<br />
But studies show that our American diet is magnesium poor, and most adults average only 66 percent of the recommended requirement of magnesium. Meanwhile, stress has been shown to leach magnesium from the body.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;So where to find this scarce mineral? Answer: in strange places. For example, the most potent magnesium source is kelp, with 780 mg of magnesium in a serving. But since kelp probably isn&rsquo;t on your dinner menu, build a meal around chickpeas instead, which contain 220 mg of magnesium in a one-cup serving.
